  <h1>The connective tissue between design, development, and users./h1>
  <p>As a content strategist, I believe finding what you're looking for online should be as painless as possible. I see content strategy as a way to bring structure to disorder, and the best structure comes from a solid foundation of listening to people (\'s pain points, goals, dreams, desires, wants).</p>
  <p>I specialize in performing quantitative and qualitative content audits (to determine a starting point), creating domain- and page-level content models (to set a precedence on how to move forward), reorganizing information architectures (to ...), and establishing an internal content production process (to create sustainable content governance).</p>
  <p>I also analyze SEO keywords for efficacy, document changes and procedures in training manuals, conduct user research to maintain alignment of project goals, and perform content migrations.</p>
